-Frist to boot in the cd or usb (usb not included sorry) press the bios button on your computer when you power it on (bios button can be Esc,f1,f2,f8,f9,f10,f11,f12,Delete,or on your boot screen you see the button or it's written press enter to interupt normal boot) after select your cd/dvd drive and set it t the top of the list and press f10, if you're only in a boot selector just higlight the cd/dvd drive then press enter.

-2 Wait the cd to boot and the text and error on your screen are normal and can be helpful if the program can't boot correctly.

-3 Now you're in the cd to go in the semi graphical menu yout need to go in a specific directory so you wil type: cd /usr/local/share/bin or cd /usr/local/bin I don't remeber but i'll give you commands to find it.
|
|__> commands : for changing directory you need to type ex: cd home or cd /home  and if you need to go to the previous directory type [cd..] . After you will want to search for what are the other directory or file in the current directory you'll type : ls.
|
|___> Now you found a file called menu.sh this file is the semi graphical menu  to run it you'll need to type [chmod +x] to make it executable after you'll run it with [./menu.sh].

-4 You're in the menu now you can see the categories and the programs now you'll see that when you try to run a program it dosen't work and say (press enter to go to the menu) that's because when you run a program the program need option that aren't defined when you simply run it with enter and that's why in the menu there's a category called command line now that you pressed enter on a program that didn't worked it's written ex:  (fdisk --help) now knowing that go on the command line option press enter and type the command to execute the program and know his option.

-5 To connect to the internet (it can be slow but helpful) in the menu you have different way to connect to the internet/wifi the easiest method is mncli but you SHOULD use nmtui because it's way more easy to setup and You'll do what I'm saying you OK!

-6 NEVER FORGET/FORGIVE THAT THE PATIENCE IS THE KEY AND FROM A CD IT'S HARD TO SAY THAT'S FAST.

-7 NEVER FORGET/FORGIVE THAT THE WHITE FLASHING LINE IS YOUR BEST FRIEND FOR EVERYTHING EVEN IF SHE'S NOT FLASHING ANYMORE!
